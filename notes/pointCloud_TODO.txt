1. performance
  - better (earlier) checks to not render extra stuff
  - use varying point density to account for du/dA and dv/dA (dA = area deformation)
2. quality
  - make inherent_rgb vary based on object.
  - i.e. map u,v to points on an image, and then make that the corresponding color on the shape.
